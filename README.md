Welcome to our BigBlueButton (BBB) bots project! We're developing innovative bots for BigBlueButton (BBB). Our mission is to enhance the BBB experience through intelligent automation, real-time assistance, and a strong commitment to open-source values and high-performance solutions.

## Our Philosophy üåç

**Open Source and Community-Driven**: We are committed to creating technology that is open, accessible, and free from data monopolies. Our projects are open source, making them available to everyone. We invite everyone to contribute, collaborate, and share in our vision of an open digital future.

**Performance Focused**: Our bots are designed to run efficiently, utilizing minimal resources without compromising functionality. We avoid using headless browsers, instead directly interacting with BBBs backend for optimal performance.

**Independent and Non-Intrusive**: Our development approach ensures that there are no modifications to the core BBB system. We aim to complement BBB without creating forks or altering its fundamental structure.

## Project Status üåü

We're in the exciting early stages, working on the first prototypes. We're focused on releasing API version 1.0.0 to fully leverage BBB features. Current capabilities include chat, closed captions, and audio channel participation.

## Our Goals üéØ‚ú®

- **Bot Development for BBB**: Creating user-friendly, resource-efficient bots for BBB.
- **Simple API**: Developing a simple API for fast and easy integration.
- **Live Transcription and Translation**: Enhancing meeting accessibility with real-time services.
- **Create more Bot examples**: Developing more bots to enrich the BBB ecosystem. Like Waiting Room Bot, FAQ Bot, and Music Bot.

## Future Vision üîÆ

- **AI Educator Assistant**: The aim is to develop an AI educational assistant that appears as a bot in BBB. It should support the educational process rather than disrupt it. Its capabilities could include personalized learning assistance, interactive educational activities and real-time academic support, while maintaining the integrity of existing educational structures. It is very important that the bot does not tell the answer. Instead, it should help the student to find the answer themselves.

## Open Source and Self-Hosting üåê

- **True Open Source**: Our projects are genuinely open, fostering a community-led digital environment.
- **Self-Hosting**: Our solutions are designed for self-hosting, ensuring full data control and customization.
